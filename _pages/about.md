#### - biography

Hello world!

I'm a final year PhD student in Computer Science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/), under the supervision of [Prof. Stelian Coros](http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).

Prior to this, I received my master's degree in Automation and Control Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) working under the supervision of [Prof. Paolo Rocco](https://rocco.faculty.polimi.it/), and a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics from [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jorge Sofrony](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37299744500/).

#### - research

Currently, my main research interests lie in the areas of; 1) Multi-arm Task and Motion Planning and 2) Manipulation of Deformable Objects. To advance the research in such areas, I leverage methods from the fields of Differentiable Simulation, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Simulation of Deformable Objects, and Trajectory Optimization.
