#### - biography
Hello world!

I'm a final year PhD student in Computer Science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the  [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/), under the supervision of [Prof. Stelian Coros](http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).

#### - research
Currently, my main research interests lie in the areas of; 1) Multi-arm Task and Motion Planning and 2) Manipulation of Deformable Objects. To advance the research in such areas, I leverage methods from the fields of Differentiable Simulation, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Simulation of Deformable Objects, and Trajectory Optimization.
